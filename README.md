# Stock and Revenue Analysis Project

This project demonstrates how to extract stock and revenue data for Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME) using Python and how to visualize the results with graphs. It covers both **web scraping** and **financial data extraction** with `yfinance`.  

## Project Overview

The assignment consists of the following tasks:

1. **Define a Function that Makes a Graph**  
   - A reusable function for plotting stock prices and revenue data side by side.

2. **Use yfinance to Extract Stock Data**  
   - Extracts historical stock data for Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME).

3. **Use Web Scraping to Extract Tesla Revenue Data**  
   - Scrapes Tesla's quarterly revenue from Macrotrends using BeautifulSoup.

4. **Use Web Scraping to Extract GME Revenue Data**  
   - Scrapes GameStop's quarterly revenue from Macrotrends using BeautifulSoup.

5. **Plot Tesla Stock Graph**  
   - Plots Tesla’s stock closing prices alongside quarterly revenue.

6. **Plot GameStop Stock Graph**  
   - Plots GameStop’s stock closing prices alongside quarterly revenue.
